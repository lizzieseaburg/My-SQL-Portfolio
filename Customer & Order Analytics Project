#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE 
  length(orderid) = 6 
  AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE 
  product = 'iPhone'
  AND length(orderid) = 6 
  AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3 Find all the account numbers for customers who placed an order in February
SELECT 
DISTINCT cust.acctnum
FROM customers as cust
JOIN FebSales as feb
  ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE 
  length(orderid) = 6 
  AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT
DISTINCT product,
price
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1

# 4.b to double check my work and make sure there weren't other items with that price 
SELECT
DISTINCT product,
price
FROM JanSales
WHERE price <=2.99

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT
product,
SUM(quantity)*price as total_rev
FROM JanSales
WHERE 
  length(orderID) = 6
  AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT
product,
SUM(quantity) as quant_sold,
SUM(quantity) * price as revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE
location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product
