# In this project I use a database containing 11 different tables relating to music, playlists, music sales, customers, and support rep employees

# 1 - Find out how many times each track was purchased
  SELECT
    i.trackid,
    t.name,
    SUM(i.quantity) as purchases
  FROM chinook.invoice_items AS i
  LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks AS t
  ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
  GROUP BY i.trackid
  ORDER BY purchases desc

#2 - Collect all the pop tracks, artist names and album names
SELECT
  t.Name as track,
  ar.Name as artist,
  al.Title as album_title

FROM chinook.tracks as t
LEFT JOIN chinook.albums as al
  ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists as ar
  ON al.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
LEFT JOIN chinook.genres as g
  ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId

WHERE g.Name = 'Pop'

ORDER BY artist

#3 - Performance review time is coming up, gather a list of all the employees and their managers

SELECT
  E.FirstName,
  E.LastName, 
  E.Title,
  M.FirstName AS Manager_FirstName,
  M.LastName AS Manager_LastName
FROM chinook.employees as E
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees as M
  ON E.ReportsTo = M.EmployeeId
ORDER BY Manager_LastName

#4 - The Sales Manager wants a list of who each of how many clients each of the sales reps has supported 
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName,
  COUNT(c.customerid) as num_customers
FROM chinook.customers AS c
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees AS e
  ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId

GROUP BY c.SupportRepid
